The Hangman game is a text-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. 
The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of the "hangman" is drawn.
If the hangman is completed before the word is guessed, the player loses.

There are two different modules named hangman_word and hangman_art.
hangman_word includes different words that will be used in the game and guessed by the user.
hangman_art consists of hangman logo and different stages that will be displayed if the user guesses an incorrect word.
